Created a database called fyyurdb using the interface.
Not sure if the migrations are powerful enough to completely create a new database.

- Created helper_files folder with helper files

password is postgrespass


- Had to add a password to get the database to work
- After database migrations, Artist and Venue were added

Todo: read Json data in
